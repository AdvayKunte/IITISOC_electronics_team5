The repository contains the verilog files of the individual components of the microprocessor along with the datapath file , where all of them are integrated. <br>
We have created a mp_tb.v , testbench to test the working of the microprocessor designed by loading in data into Memory and instructions in the Instruction Memory as done by us in the mp_tb.v file  <br>
Hence upon downloading all the files and running the mp_tb.v file , will lead to simulation of working of the microprocessor  <br>

You may refer to this chart to try and run instructions based on the given format of coding  <br>
<h2>For R type instruction </h2>  <br>
    Pls enter OpCode depending upon type of instruction , the ALU fn as necessary and then leave the next two bits 00 and then the remaining 9 bits to be register<br>     addresses of the Write , read1 and read2 registers <br>
<h2>For I type instruction </h2> <br>
    Pls enter the OpCode depending upon type of instruction , the immediate value , <br>
    For example the addi : The immediate value will be the second adding value in 7 bits as would like to be passed <br>
    For the load word store word instruction -: <br>
    Write the immediate and choose register at address 000 or the one at adress 111 ( one is default 0 value and another default 127 value) <br>
    And then the address at the memory location would be immediate ( 8bit extended positive from 1 to 128) and the register value hence going from 0 to 255<br>
<h2> For J type instruction </h2> <br>
   Write the Opcode and 8 bit immediate and leave others unused. <br>
You may refer to the sample instructions already loaded in the instruction register<br>
